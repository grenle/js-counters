#+TITLE: Simple Counters for javascript
#+AUTHOR: Gregory Houldsworth (grenle)

Here are some simple but useful JavaScript classes. There are:

- ~Counter~: a simple counting device for keys. Similar in
  spirit to Python.
- ~Counter_With_Last_Modified~: A simple counting device for
  keys. Also remembers last time a key was updated.
- ~Perishable_Counter~ A simple counting device for
  keys. Keys too old can be [automatically] erased and will
  appear to have a count of 0.
- ~Counter_With_Limit_Check~ Provides a counter that can
  check(key) for an associated value larger than established
  class-wide limit.

Counter is simple to use:

#+begin_example
> const  c = new Counter()
> c.inc('foo')
> c.inc('foo')
> c.inc('bar')
> c.get('foo')
2
> c.get('bar')
1
> c.get('baz')
0
#+end_example
